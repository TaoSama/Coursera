#### Python and Vectorization

>SIMD: single instruction, multiple data
>IID: identically independently distributed

```python
# Whenever possible, avoid explicit for-loops.

# Python broadcasting
# For a mÃ—n matrix, the general principle:
(m, n) +-*/ (m, 1) -> (m, n)   
(m, n) +-*/ (1, n) -> (m, n)   
```

This past week there was an article in Mashable about a 16-year-old in United Kingdom, who is one of the leaders on Kaggle competitions.
And it just said, he just went out and learned things, found things online, learned everything himself and never actually took any formal course per se.
And there is a 16-year-old just being very competitive in Kaggle competition, so it's definitely possible. 
We live in good times. If people want to learn.
